taste bud

 - Major sensory receptor on the tongue; contains taste hairs that send impulses to the brain for interpretation of tastes. 

deciduous forest

 - Biome usually having four distinct seasons, temperate annual precipitation of 75-150 cm, and climax communities of deciduous trees. 

temperate rain forest 

 – Biome with 200-400 cm of precipitation each year, average temperatures between 9-12 degrees C, and forest dominated by trees with needle-like leaves. 

tendon

 - Thick band of tissue that attaches bones to muscles. 

tentacles

 – Arm-like structures that have stinging cells and surround the mouths of most cnidarians.

tissue

 - Group of similar cells that work together to do one job. 

toxin

 - Poisonous substance produced by some pathogens. 

trachea

 - Air-conducting tube that connects the larynx with the bronchi, is lined with mucous membranes and cilia, and contains strong cartilage rings. 

tropical rain forest

 - Most biologically diverse biome; has an average temperature of 25 degrees C and receives 200-600 cm of precipitation each year. 

tropism

 - Positive or negative plant response to an external stimulus such as touch, light, or gravity. 

tube feet

 - Hydraulic, hollow, thin-walled tubes that end in suction cups and enable echinoderms to move. 

tundra

 - Cold, dry, treeless biome with less than 25 cm of precipitation each year, a short growing season, permafrost, and winters that can be six to nine months long. 

umbilical  cord

 - Connects the embryo to the placenta; moves food and oxygen from the placenta to the embryo and removes the embryo's waste products. 

ureter

 - Tube that carries urine from 

urethra

 - Tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. 

urine

 - Wastewater that contains excess water, salts, and other wastes that are not reabsorbed by the body. 

urinary system

 - System of excretory organs that rids the blood of wastes, controls blood volume by removing excess water, and balances concentrations of salts and water. 

uterus

 - Hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ where a fertilized egg develops into a baby. 

vaccination

 - Process of giving a vaccine by mouth or by injection to provide active immunity against a disease. 

vaccine

 - Preparation made from killed bacteria or damaged particles from bacterial cell walls that can prevent some bacterial diseases. 

vaccine

 - A solution made from damaged virus or bacteria particles or from killed or weakened viruses or bacteria; can prevent, but not cure, many viral and bacterial diseases. 

vagina

 -Muscular tube that connects the lower end of the uterus to the outside of the body; the birth canal through which a baby travels when being born. 

variable

 - In an experiment, the one thing that can change. 

variation

 - Inherited trait that makes an individual different from other members of the same species and results from a mutation in the organism's genes. 

vascular plant

 - Plant with tubelike structures that move minerals, water, and other substances throughout the plant. 

vein

 - Blood vessel that carries blood back to the heart and has one-way valves that keep blood moving toward the heart. 

ventricles

 Two lower chambers of the heart that contract at the same time during a heartbeat. 

vertebrae 

 – backbones that are joined by flexible cartilage and protect a vertabrate’s spinal nerve cord. 

vertebrate

 - Animal with a backbone. 

vestigial structure

 - Structure, such as the human appendix, that doesn't seem to have a function and may once have functioned in the body of an ancestor. 

villi

 - Fingerlike projections covering the wall of the small intestine that increase the surface area for food absorption. 

virus

 - Extremely tiny piece of genetic material that infects and multiplies in host cells; surrounded by a protein coating. 

vitamin 

voluntary muscle

 - Muscle, such as a leg or arm muscle, that can be consciously controlled. 

water cycle

 - Model describing how water moves from Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back to the surface again through evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. 

water vascular system

 - Network of water-filled canals that allows echinoderms to move, capture food, give off wastes, and exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen. 

wetland 

 – A region that is wet most or all of the year. 

xylem

 - Vascular tissue that forms hollow vessels that transport substances, other than sugar, throughout a plant. 

zygote

 - New diploid cell formed when a sperm fertilizes an egg; will divide by mitosis and develop into a new organism.
